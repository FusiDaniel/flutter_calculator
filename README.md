# Knwon Issues
- Very high doubles prints in exponential format, like: 2e+15, and it breakes the solver
- if you select something and press a key, it doesnt substitute the selection by the key
- values that goes to infinity are rounded, and doesn't combine back to non infinte long values (or maybe it's not a problem)


# To do
- AC button (press to backspace, hold to del)
- refactoring FisicalKeyboardListener
- ()
- %
